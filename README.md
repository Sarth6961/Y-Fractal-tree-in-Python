# Y-Fractal-tree-in-Python
A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos.

In this article, we will draw a colorful Y fractal tree using a recursive technique in Python.
